			"wtf its hardly noticeable where the money goes in Georgia????? daily club mate + a couple of cold matcha + groceries + khinkali and there goes 100 bucks. on april 1st, it was 22 degrees. I've been here for 3 weeks already and still haven't been to the mountains. hoping to go there mid-month. started working on a mobile app version of Learn Anything, finding expo tabs super inconvenient. All my liras in the turkish bank acc have been depleted, and converting from $ is only possible by logging into the bank with a turkish number, which can only be topped up in Istanbul üêá. listening to spotify on airpods max feels like a throwback to 2017",

I drank 100 cups of coffee and went horseback riding twice. already earned my first $2000 from two projects, and there‚Äôs a hackathon coming up that im participating in with my bf! ‚ô• looking forward to my trip to the Princes Islands to cycle around and read in my fav coffeeplace. next month will be filled with the hassle of arranging Spanish and French visas. Istanbul is beautiful when you‚Äôre just a tourist! can't wait for my partner to arrive so I can show him my favorite spots yay",

				it. cooool

Im trying to make more interesting friends in georgia, but the weather and work are killing me )",
