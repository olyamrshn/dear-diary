			"wtf its hardly noticeable where the money goes in Georgia????? daily club mate + a couple of cold matcha + groceries + khinkali and there goes 100 bucks. on april 1st, it was 22 degrees. I've been here for 3 weeks already and still haven't been to the mountains. hoping to go there mid-month. started working on a mobile app version of Learn Anything, finding expo tabs super inconvenient. All my liras in the turkish bank acc have been depleted, and converting from $ is only possible by logging into the bank with a turkish number, which can only be topped up in Istanbul üêá. listening to spotify on airpods max feels like a throwback to 2017",

I drank 100 cups of coffee and went horseback riding twice. already earned my first $2000 from two projects, and there‚Äôs a hackathon coming up that im participating in with my bf! ‚ô• looking forward to my trip to the Princes Islands to cycle around and read in my fav coffeeplace. next month will be filled with the hassle of arranging Spanish and French visas. Istanbul is beautiful when you‚Äôre just a tourist! can't wait for my partner to arrive so I can show him my favorite spots yay",

				was a brilliant idea. a similar app has already been made for New York,
				but we planned to make ours on a larger scale. it happens. maybe we'll
				get lucky later. there's a loooot of work this month and constant trips
				back and forth from ist to tbilisi for residency renewal. in georgia, we
				got a Kitten, and he ran away after +- four days. someone else took him
				from the street. i will miss you... went swimming in the cold marble sea
				with my bf. he said he wasn't thrilled about it, but he doesn't regret
				it. cooool

			"came back to tbilisi to spend two weeks here before heading to petersburg. recently realized that I havent cooked for myself in almost six months... its been cafes and restaurants every day. honestly, living like this makes it hard to get excited about posting pretty food shots when its your daily routine. btw im not complaining and everything is great. and hooooray, now i have an invitation to Spain and there shouldnt be any problems getting a visa. if it doesnt work out, it will be a long path to getting a nomad. in mid-august have adventure to Kazan for nix conference and a techno festival. Im trying to make more interesting friends in georgia, but the weather and work are killing me )",

				feel exhausted from this period. don't think i have ever changed cities
				so frequently - Petersburg, Moscow, train to Kaluga for Signal fest,
				back to Moscow, train to Kazan, flight back to Saint P. Home, cottage,
				sleeping in a cold tent with bugs, hostels and hotels.
				<br />
				<br />
				üìù Note to self: never repeat such a packed schedule and always book
				hotels in advance. and definitely not on my own dime if dont want to go.
				that's the golden rule.
				<br />
				<br />
				really enjoyed the festival, met a lot of cool people. had laptop detox
				for 4 days!!! music only started late in the evening, with lectures and
				walks with coffee during the day. sank into a deep depression this
				month. The sugar mommy role is definitely not for me, and I hate taking
				100% responsibility. also felt crappy in Kazan at the nix sprint where
				there were no other women, and guys told me I couldnt stay at their
				house, so I had to find an overpriced hostel because all the hotels were
				unreasonably expensive!!! btw, my place turned out to be nice and right
				in the center, so I often walked to the park by black lake and had
				lovely girl roommates. so glad im heading home to saint p soon.
